        After over a decade working in credit and financial risk management
        across Australia, Hong Kong, London and New York, I&apos;ve decided to

        <span className="font-bold ">software engineering</span>
        .
        <div className="h-2 md:h-12" />
        Spurred on by those around me and my love of building things, I&apos;m
        excited to be diving in full time into a hobby I&apos;ve had since high
        school.

        This site is dedicated to my journey thus far.
